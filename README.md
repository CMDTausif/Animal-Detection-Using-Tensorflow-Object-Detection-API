# Animal-Detection-Using-Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API
This project implements a real time object detection like animal detection using ssd_mobilenet algorithm.
SSD-Mobilenet is an algorithm or model of Tensorflow object detection which stands for Simgle Shot Detector.  
I have implemented the algorithm for training the model from scratch in python.
