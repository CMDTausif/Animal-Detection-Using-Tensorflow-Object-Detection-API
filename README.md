# Animal-Detection-Using-Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API
This project implements a real time object detection like animal detection using ssd_mobilenet algorithm. SSD-Mobilenet is an algorithm or model of Tensorflow object detection which stands for Single Shot Detector. I have implemented this algorithm for training the model from scratch in python.
